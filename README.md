Aqueduct gives you a simple Python-native API to define machine learning pipelines, the ability to deploy those pipelines on your existing infrastructure (e.g., Spark, Kubernetes, Lambda), and visibility into the code, data, and metadata associated with your workflows. 
Aqueduct is fully open-source and runs securely in your cloud.
